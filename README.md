## 🎓 Project Highlights

- **Notebook-Based**: Fully developed in a Jupyter Notebook for transparency, experimentation, and educational clarity.
- **Computer Vision**: Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing and visualization.
- **Deep Learning**: Employs a CNN model to detect and classify traffic signs with high accuracy.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to expand, modify, and integrate with real-time systems.

## 📊 Dataset

The system was trained and tested using a dataset of labeled traffic sign images, containing a wide variety of signs under diverse conditions.

- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented.
- **Split**: Dataset divided into training, validation, and test sets.

> **Note:** The dataset used is either publicly available or custom-collected. If redistribution is not allowed, please link to the official source.
